# [GRID](http://personal.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~ccloy/downloads_qmul_underground_reid.html)

GRID is collected by 8 disjoint cameras in a busy underground station. Each identity has two images from different views and there are more images in the gallery set than the probe set. The image quality of this dataset is fairly poor.
