# [3DPeS](http://www.openvisor.org/3dpes.asp)

3DPeS dataset is collected by 8 non-overlapped outdoor cameras. Although the original video is provided, researchers always use the selected snapshots to test person re-identification algorithms. It has 3D model for the environment and the calibration data for all cameras. In video sequences, only the bounding boxes of the first appearing frame of each identity are provided.
