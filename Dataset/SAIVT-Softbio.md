# [SAIVT-Softbio](https://researchdatafinder.qut.edu.au/display/n27416)

SAIVT-Softbio is collected by eight existing surveillance cameras. Since it's an uncontrolled collection, most identities only pass through a subset of cameras. This dataset also provides the whole video frames with labeled bounding box on every frame, but the bounding boxes are not very tight for some instances.

# 简介

SAIVT - Softbio由8个现有的监控摄像头收集。由于这是不受控制的收集，大多数身份只能通过一部分摄像头。该数据集还提供了整个视频帧的标签边界框在每一帧，但边界框不是非常紧密的一些实例。
