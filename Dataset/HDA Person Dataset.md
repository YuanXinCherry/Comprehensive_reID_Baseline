# [HDA Person Dataset](http://vislab.isr.ist.utl.pt/hda-dataset/)

HDA dataset is proposed to mimic the real person re-identification system as close as possible. Within it, 85 persons were densely labeled across 13 cameras during 30 mins. In addition to the tight bounding boxes, the author also proivdes the occlusion flag, camera homographies and synchronization. Image qualities are vary from 640x480 to 2560x1600 and FPSs are vary from 1 to 5. A nice evaluation tool is provided to test the re-id algorithm, person detector or both of them. Six different protocols are included to analysis the whole re-id system. Detections from ACF are provided.

# 简介

提出HDA数据集，尽可能模拟真实的人再识别系统。其中，85人在30分钟内通过13个摄像机被密集地标记。除了严密的边界框外，作者还提供了遮挡标志、相机同一性和同步。图像质量从640x480到2560x1600不等，fps从1到5不等。提供了一个很好的评估工具来测试重新识别算法、人员检测器或两者。六种不同的协议包括分析整个重新识别系统。提供来自ACF的检测。
