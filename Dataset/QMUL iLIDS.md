# [QMUL iLIDS](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~jason/data/i-LIDS_Pedestrian.tgz)

QMUL iLIDS is based on iLIDS MCTS, a dataset collected in an airport during busy time by a multi-camera CCTV system. Almost every identity has four images from two non-overlapping cameras. This dataset has senarios with heavy occlusion and pose variance.
