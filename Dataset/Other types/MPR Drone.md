# [MPR Drone](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~rlayne/downloads_qmul_drone_dataset.html)

MPR Drone dataset is not a traditional person person re-identification dataset with images captured across a camera network. Instead, it is collected by a flying drone in both indoor and outdoor environment. Since it only has one camera, the author proposed three different types of evaluation experiments in the original paper. All pedestrian detections are obtained by pyramid feature detection in Piotr Dollar's toolbox. It has two sub-datasets. Dataset 01 has been exhaustively labeled for 113610 detections. Dataset 02 provides the raw frame data for Dataset 01.

# 简介

MPR无人机数据集不是一个传统的人人再识别数据集通过摄像头网络捕获的图像。相反，它是由一个飞行的无人机在室内和室外环境收集。由于它只有一个摄像头，作者在原文中提出了三种不同类型的评价实验。所有行人检测均采用Piotr Dollar工具箱中的金字塔特征检测。它有两个子数据集。数据集01已被详尽地标记为113610次检测。数据集02为数据集01提供原始帧数据。
