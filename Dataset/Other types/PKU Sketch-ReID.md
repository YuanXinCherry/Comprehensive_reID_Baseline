# [PKU Sketch-ReID](https://www.pkuml.org/resources/pkusketchreid-dataset.html)

This dataset contains 200 persons, each of which has one sketch and two photos. Photos of each person were captured during daytime by two cross-view cameras. The raw images (or video frames) are cropped manually to make sure that every photo contains one specific person. There are 5 artists to draw all persons’ sketches and every artist has his own painting style.
