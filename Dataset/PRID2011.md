PRID dataset has 385 trajectories from camera A and 749 trajectories from camera B. Among them, only 200 people appear in both cameras. This dataset also has a single shot version, which consists with random selected snapshots. Some trajectories are not well-synchronized, which means the person might "jump" between consecutive frames.
