# [CAVIAR4ReID](https://lorisbaz.github.io/caviar4reid.html)

This dataset is extracted from a multi-target tracking dataset CAVIAR, which is collected in a shopping mall by two surveillance cameras with overlapped view field. Among 72 identities, 50 of them have images from two camera views and the rest 22 only from one camera. Images for each identity are carefully selected to maximize the resolustion variance.
